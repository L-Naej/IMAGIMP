IMAGIMP
=======

Mini image processing software developped for a C course at the IMAC engineering school. 
Layers management, effect management by layer (contrast, luminosity, sepia, black and white...), possibility to save the resulting image. 
Uses a little custom library for the GUI (developped by our teacher).
